# verilog-password-checker
This Real-Time Password Checker project is a simple Verilog design that verifies a fixed-length password entered character-by-character in real-time. The password is hardcoded as "1234" (ASCII codes). The module continuously checks the input characters on each clock cycle and asserts a match signal when the correct password sequence is entered.
